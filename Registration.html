COOKIE POLICY

his Policy was last updated on May 14, 2018
Cookies allow a website to remember your preferences and improve the user experience. Cookies are sent back to the originating site on each subsequent visit or to another site that recognizes the cookie.
We also use other forms of technology which serve a similar purpose to cookies and which allow us to monitor and improve our sites. We use these in connection with cookies to help operate our websites and emails and collect information about online activity. When we talk about cookies in this Policy, this term includes these similar technologies. Why do we use cookies?
We use cookies for two purposes:
1.     To provide you with the service you have requested. We use these cookies to enable you to move around our sites and to use their features.
2.     To analyse and improve your browsing experience.

They also allow our sites to remember choices you make (such as the region you are in) and to provide you with enhanced and more personalised features.
Some newer web browsers incorporate “Do Not Track” features. Our websites may not currently respond to “Do Not Track” requests or headers from these browsers. Opting out of this practice does not opt you out of being served advertising — you will continue to receive generic ads.
